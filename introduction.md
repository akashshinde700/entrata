# Perfect Self Introduction Script - Entrata Job Profile

**FINAL VERSION (Most Natural & Professional):**

"Good afternoon! I'm Akash Deepak Shinde. Thank you for letting me introduce myself. I'm a backend developer with over two years of experience building and maintaining web applications. I love creating systems that are fast, secure, and reliable.

I'm excited about the Software Engineer role at Entrata because I enjoy solving technical problems and building solutions that help people, especially in property management.

At my last job with Mulsan Information Technology, I worked with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to create strong backend systems. I improved database speed by 30%, built fast APIs, and added security features like JWT and RBAC to protect data.

I also worked well with designers and product managers, which helped me improve my teamwork and communication skills. I left Mulsan in July 2025 to learn more and prepare for my next career step.

Now, I want a role where I can use my backend skills, learn from talented engineers, and work on big, meaningful projects. I think Entrata is a great fit, and I'm eager to help with your mission to make property management easier through technology."
