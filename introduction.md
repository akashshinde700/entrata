# Introduction

Good afternoon! I'm **Akash Deepak Shinde**. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. 

I'm a backend developer with over two years of experience in building and maintaining web applications, and I'm passionate about creating efficient and reliable systems.

## Why Entrata?

I'm very interested in the Software Engineer role at Entrata because I enjoy solving technical challenges and building systems that make people's lives easier — especially in the property management space.

## Professional Experience

In my previous role at **Mulsan Information Technology**, I worked mainly with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to build secure and high-performing backend systems. 

Some of my key contributions include:

- Optimizing database performance
- Developing RESTful APIs with fast response times
- Implementing JWT and RBAC-based security frameworks

Working closely with designers and product managers also helped me strengthen my teamwork and communication skills. I left Mulsan in July 2025 to focus on improving my technical skills and preparing for my next professional challenge.

## What I'm Looking For

Now, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can apply my backend expertise, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to large-scale projects — and I believe Entrata is the perfect place to do that.
