# Introduction

**Good afternoon!**

I'm **Akash Deepak Shinde**. Thank you for letting me introduce myself. I'm a backend developer with over two years of experience building and maintaining web applications. I love creating systems that are fast, secure, and reliable.

## Why Entrata?

I'm excited about the Software Engineer role at Entrata because I enjoy solving technical problems and building solutions that help people, especially in property management.

## Professional Experience

At my last job with **Mulsan Information Technology**, I worked with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to create strong backend systems. Here are some of my key achievements:

- **Improved database speed by 30%**
- **Built fast and efficient APIs**
- **Added security features** like JWT and RBAC to protect data

I also worked well with designers and product managers, which helped me improve my teamwork and communication skills. I left Mulsan in July 2025 to learn more and prepare for my next career step.

## What I'm Looking For

Now, I want a role where I can:

- Use my backend skills to solve real-world problems
- Learn from talented engineers
- Work on big, meaningful projects

I think Entrata is a great fit, and I'm eager to help with your mission to make property management easier through technology.
